## Curriculum overview

## Approach to Lecture
- Zoom link posted on Discord `lecture-links` channel before lecture time
- 2-hour long, 10-minute break in between
- Ask questions in chat, or raise your hand (`Alt + Y`)
- Video on if you can
- Do **not** code along (feel free to take notes, run small experiments)
- Lecture notes and recording will be posted in Discord (available on Compass)

### Expectations
- Don't expect to understand all 100% material covered immediately.
- Get in a habit of coming back to lecture recording/notes, working examples when working on new problems
- Ask questions (during lectures, ARs)
